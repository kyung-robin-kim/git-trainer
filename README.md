## Exercises

1. Numberizer

I wrote some math forumulas, but I did a bad job. Fork the repo, then create a branch for each error you find. Have your team each checkout a branch, commit and push their fix, and then get a mentor to check over your work before merging to master

2. tic-tac-toe

Play tic-tac-toe on github. Branch or Fork the repo, then use branching and merging to make moves.

3. stop-the-presses

I overloaded python's print function. Make branches and mess around, see if you can add some fun functionality.
